# Option Pricing in Java ðŸ“ˆ

This project implements a core Black-Scholes pricing engine for European options in pure Java, along with Greek
calculators. Itâ€™s the first in a series of projects reconnecting with equity derivatives after 25 years â€” with a modern
tech mindset.

## Features

- âœ… Black-Scholes pricing for calls and puts
- âœ… Calculation of Greeks: delta, gamma, theta, vega, rho
- âœ… Implied volatility solver (coming soon)
- âœ… CLI or REST interface (planned)
- âœ… 100% unit tested
## Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Git

## Usage

```java
BlackScholesCalculator.calcPrice(
    OptionType.CALL,
    spotPrice,
    strikePrice,
    timeToMaturity,
    riskFreeRate,
    volatility
);
```

## Running the application

You can start the Spring Boot service via the Gradle wrapper:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

By default, the server listens on portÂ 8080. Check health with:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/
# OK
```

## Motivation

I worked on the exotic derivatives desk in the late 90s as a UI developer. This is my way of returning â€” not as a trader
or quant, but as an architect who can build the right tools for the domain.

## Building and Testing

Use the included Gradle wrapper (`./gradlew`) as the main build tool to compile and test:

```bash
./gradlew clean check
```

Tests are written in Groovy using the Spock framework and organized into:

- **Unit tests** (`src/test/groovy`)
- **Integration tests** (`src/integrationTest/groovy`)
- **End-to-end tests** (`src/e2eTest/groovy`)

## Continuous Integration

A GitHub Actions workflow is configured in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to run tests on push and pull requests to `main`. Merges to `main` should require passing this CI.
